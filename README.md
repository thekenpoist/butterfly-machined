## G-code with Macros example for CNC machinery

### G-code explained
```
G-code, also known as RS-274, is the standard programming language 
for CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines. It is used to instruct 
CNC machines on how to move, what path to follow, and how to perform 
specific actions to create precise parts from various materials. 
```

### Macros explained
```
Macros programming for Haas CNC machines involves creating custom 
G-code programs using variables, conditional statements, and loops 
to automate complex machining operations and enhance flexibility.

By using macros, programmers can enhance the efficiency and functionality 
of their CNC programs, allowing for more sophisticated and automated 
machining processes on CNC machineery.

### The butterfly-machined example
'''
In this program macros is being implemented to access machine global parameters
for tracking and managing tool life, control turret indexing positions, and 
activate the ATP (Automated Tool Presetter) when tool geometry needs to be 
re-set after tool change, relieving the machine operator of these responsibilites.
